## ‚ú® Project Overview & Core Features

The primary goal of this project is to deliver a high-fidelity user experience that celebrates the Digimon aesthetic through advanced design implementation in Tailwind CSS.

### 1. High-Fidelity UI/UX

* **Aesthetic:** Uses a deep, dark theme (void-like background) contrasted sharply with vibrant **neon blue, cyan, and magenta accents** to emulate a high-tech data terminal.
* **Thematic Design:** Incorporates custom fonts and stylized headings to maintain a consistent sci-fi/cyberpunk atmosphere across all views.
* **Digital Effects:** Subtle visual touches, like **image scanning lines** and **pulsating neon glows**, bring the dynamic console feel to life.

### 2. Advanced Data Visualization

* **Custom Stat Bars:** Digimon statistics are presented using unique, rectangular progress bars designed to look like they are **recessed into a console panel**. They feature an intense inner shadow and a digital energy fill effect.
* **Evolution Tree:** Digivolution paths are displayed via **large, interconnected, and interactive data nodes**, allowing users to easily visualize the lineage and navigate seamlessly between related Digimon.
* **Data Panels:** Key metadata (Generation, Attribute, Type, Personality) is housed within **sleek, translucent data cards** that mimic floating heads-up display (HUD) elements.
